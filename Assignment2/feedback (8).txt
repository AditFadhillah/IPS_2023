General comments:
Task 1:
1a. ok
1b. ok, there is no explicit sequence operator. 
    (The dot should be removed)
1c. ok
2a. ok
2b. ok
2c. ok
3a. Are you sure that that is what would happen?
3b. Incorrect. Have you tried doing it?
3c. Note that $1 is just the position of the let token.

Task 2:
Some valid variable names are parsed incorrectly.
Fx. 'AZaz_09', 'x__0', 'x_0yy_z1' and 'x_'
Incorrect precedence when parsing, for example '2+3*4'

Task 3:
ok.

Task 4:
Incorrect.
