# Overall

Todo for resubmission:
  - Fix max/argmax in calculator.fsx (result and error reporting)
  - Fix error reporting in task 3

# Task 1

Ok.

# Task 2

Your max/argmax returns wrong results when e3 is negative.
For example '(arg)max x=1 to 10 of 0-x' should give -1/(1).
It should also give an error when the upper bound is less than the lower bound.

Note that the ranges can be solved in a purely functional way while maintaining
the efficiency of the impure approach using tail-recursion. 
In IPS it is preferred (but not required in this case) for you to use F# in a funcional manner.

# Task 3

Your code gives a slightly incorrect error on wrong input. (The 0)
