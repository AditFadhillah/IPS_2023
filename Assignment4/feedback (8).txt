Todo for resubmission:
  - Finish task 2
  - Fix task 3
  - Fix task 4

General comments:

Task 1:
Correct.

Task 2:
c. There is only interference when the kill-set is non-empty.
f. You are missing the code after spilling.

Task 3:
Minor swap-up between the transitions from 3 and 4.
There should be a few more (2) states when constructing 'a*b'.

Task 4:
The epsilon-closures are too big. 
In general any of final states do not represent more than 4 original states.

This does not cause an issue in the final DFA, however there should be an a-transition in s4.
(The final set should not be empty)
