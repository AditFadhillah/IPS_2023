General comments:

Task 1:
You can use v0 and v1 as registers directly.
Try to follow the translation table exactly, as you are taking a lot of shortcuts.

Also make sure to follow the translation table for the machine code section.

Task 2:
Consider reversing the order of rules in the table, as the first rule overshadows the last two.
The second rule has some issues when rz is any value other than 0 and 1 (they should become 0 as well).
rz and rw both have the wrong result in the third rule (both are opposite of what they should be).

Task 3:
a. You are allocating too much memory (each element is a single byte)
b. Refer to the assignent text how to write the call to another function for this assignment.
